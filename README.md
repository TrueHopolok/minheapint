# Min heap for integers on c++

### About the project

Project made for university as a honored task to get extra points for a higher grade.

The task to sort a given array from stdin using customly written min heap class splitted into 2 files.
- `minheap_int.h` - header that defines all methods
- `minheap_int.cpp` - contains all of realisations

Since custom class was used, testing also is required.

Whole task additionlay written in `main.cpp` file as in all laborotory works.

### How to build

I didn't use a Codeblocks and build project via linux/bash console. Provided commands should also work in Windows.

To build the main part of the task (about sorting an array):
```bash
g++ main.cpp minheap.cpp
```

To build the testing part of the task:
```bash
g++ test.cpp minheap.cpp
```

After that just execute the builded files to get a results.
